# Intro to Public Key Cryptography

In this post, we'll look at the basics of working with Public/Private Key Cryptography from a developer's perspective. We'll talk a bit about the history and advantages of public-key encryption without going too deep into the mathematic ideas that make it all work (perhaps I'll cover this in a future post after doing more research so I can understand it myself...)

## History: Cryptography is Hard

The term Cryptography comes from Greek words for "secret writing," and it seems that people have been trying to write secretly for pretty much as long as they've been trying to write at all. At its core cryptography deals with hiding the contents of a message so it can only be read by those who we choose and over the centuries, cryptographers developed a lot of techniques for doing this. Meanwhile, their adversaries, known as _cryptanalysts_, have been constantly trying to undo everything the cryptographers come up with.

There's a lot of interesting stuff to read about in the history of cryptography, but one over-arching trend we can see is a grudging march toward heavy reliance on randomness. The problem, it turns out, is that human language is very _un_-random. Each language has very distinct observable patterns -- in English, for example, we tend to use a lot of vowels, especially "a" and "e" -- and over the years code-breakers were constantly able to use these tendencies to crack into messages. This was especially easy given our tendency to use predictable or formulaic encryption schemes -- rotate letters of the alphabet according to the offsets of a sweetheart's name, a birthdate, etc.

Over time, cryptographers had to accept that the only way to reliably encrypt something is to use true randomness to thoroughly scramble a message. This is best embodied in one of the few encryption schemes believed to be truly unbreakable -- the [One-Time Pad][otp].

__A One-Time Pad:__

By using random keys, cryptographers were able to escape the inherent predictability of human language. But even this approach comes with some cumbersome restrictions. First, you can't re-use the key. As soon as the randomness of the original key starts to be repeated, patterns emerge, and we're right back where we started (hence _one_-time pad). Note that this includes encrypting messages longer than the key itself, since we would have to re-use key digits. Finally, if we want to reliably use this scheme, we need to distribute and keep track of a *ton* of keys!

And this lands us in a bit of a catch-22. We can't share quality random keys securely if we don't have a good crypto scheme. And we can't have a good crypto scheme of we can't share keys securely... If designing good cryptosystems is the first problem of cryptography, then figuring out reasonable key exchange systems rapidly became the second. Especially from a pragmatic perspective, this often became the biggest question when implementing a new cryptosystem -- the algorithm might be exquisite, but if the key exchange can't be worked out then it's no good to anyone.

## Cutting the Gordian Knot with Public-Private Key Cryptography

This all changed in the 1970's with the discovery of Public-Key encryption. Up to this point, cryptosystems had been based on a _symmetric_ approach to encryption and decryption -- that is, the same key is used both for encrypting and for decrypting the message. This imposes the key-exchange difficulty we just looked at since the sender and receiver need to figure out some means of sharing the key without also letting it fall into enemy hands.

The great innovation of PK Crypto was to move to an _asymmetric_ encryption model where encryption and decryption are done using _separate_ keys. The keys come in pairs, and the pairs are mathematically linked (more on that in a second) so that the encryption-key of the pair can be used to encrypt a message which only its associated decryption key can decrypt.

Instead of attempting to share the same keys around all the time and keep them out of the eyes of eavesdroppers, we can simply each have our own _pair_. If you want to send me a message, I can send you my _encryption_ key. You use that key to encrypt your message, send it to me, and I can then use my corresponding _decryption_ key to read it. The real beauty of this system is that the encryption key is useless for _de_-crypting, so I don't have to be particularly careful about how I distribute it. In fact, there's no harm in shouting it from the roof-top or posting it on my website. Hence we tend to refer to the decryption key as our **Public Key**.

The decryption key, on the other hand, is still precious. Anyone who has it can read all messages encrypted with the corresponding encryption (Public) key. It obviously needs to be kept secret, but the problem is greatly simplified now since we no longer need to share it with anyone. Thus we refer to this key as our **Private Key**.

## So how does it really work?

The short answer is: Math.
